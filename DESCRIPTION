Description: This package provides extensive functionality for
    comparing results obtained by different methods for
    differential expression analysis of RNAseq data. It also
    contains functions for simulating count data. Finally, it provides 
    convenient interfaces to several packages for performing the 
    differential expression analysis. These can also be used as templates
    for setting up and running a user-defined differential analysis 
    workflow within the framework of the package.
