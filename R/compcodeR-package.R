#' RNAseq data simulation, differential expression analysis and 
#' performance comparison of differential expression methods
#' 
#' This package provides extensive functionality for comparing 
#' results obtained by different methods for differential expression analysis
#' of RNAseq data. It also contains functions for simulating count data and
#' interfaces to several packages for performing the differential expression analysis.
